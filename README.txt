===== SUPER TIC TAC TOE =====

1. Description

This game is played like TTT but on a larger scale. To win,
you must get 3 in a row on the big 3x3 board. The big board
consists of 9 smaller 3x3 boards. To capture a large box on
the bigger board, you must win the smaller one. However, the
next player's move must be in within the larger box that
corresponds to your move.

For example, if player 1 picks the bottom right small square
of the center box, player 2 must play his move in the bottom
right box and so on.
